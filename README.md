# k-ary Tree Container with GUI Visualization

## Overview
This project implements a k-ary tree container in C++, supporting various operations and iterators for tree traversal. Additionally, it includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the tree structure.

## Features
- **k-ary Tree Container:** Supports insertion of nodes, traversal using iterators (Pre-Order, Post-Order, In-Order, BFS, DFS), and conversion to a binary heap.
- **GUI Visualization:** Displays the tree structure using a graphical interface for better understanding and debugging.
- **Support for Various Data Types:** Handles keys of any type (e.g., integers, strings, custom classes like Complex numbers).

## Implementation Details
- **Tree Container:** Implements add_root, add_sub_node, and destructor methods.
- **Iterators:** Provides iterators for Pre-Order, Post-Order, In-Order, BFS, and DFS traversal methods.
- **Heap Conversion:** Includes a method to convert the binary tree to a minimum heap.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Uses SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for rendering and visualizing the tree structure.

## Getting Started
1. **Dependencies:** Ensure SFML is installed (`libsfml-dev` on Linux) for GUI rendering.
2. **Compilation:** Use the provided Makefile to compile the main program (`make tree`).
3. **Execution:** Run the program to see the GUI visualization of the k-ary tree.
